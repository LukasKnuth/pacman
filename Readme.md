# Pacman

This is a pacman clone I built some years back when I was still learning to program.

The implementation is based heavily on the [Pacman Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info/).

This was developed and tested under Java 1.6

## Build

- Run `./gradlew build` to build all files
- Run `./gradlew run` to run the game as a Java Swing application
- Run `./gradlew jar` to build an executable JAR file under `build/libs/pacman.jar`
